#If you have not started already, begin designing the classes you think you will need for your project. Review the components of your GUI and make sure you have one, and only one, class for each type of object that either:
#Moves independently from the background
#Interacts with another object


#Background that scrolls down

#holds

#Fall timer

#choose rocks

#Climber class that has list of all the individual body parts
#  Arm
#  Leg
#  Head and body
#  Utility class that helps the arm moves in unison

#Mouse click down, drag, mouse click up

#Need physics arm with anchor point
